🔧 Feature Engineering = What you do
It’s about designing the right features for the model to learn from.

In NLP:

Cleaning the text

Removing stop words

Tokenizing

Lemmatizing/stemming

Converting words to vectors (TF-IDF, word2vec, BERT, etc.)

Maybe even counting things like “number of exclamation marks”

🧠 Goal:

Turn raw text into meaningful signals that the model can learn patterns from.

⚙️ Pipeline = How you organize the steps
It’s the workflow you build to apply all those preprocessing steps in sequence.

Think of a pipeline as the recipe that runs:

python
Copy
Edit
text → lowercase → remove punctuation → tokenize → remove stopwords → stem/lemmatize
🧠 Goal:

Ensure consistency, modularity, and reusability of preprocessing logic.

🧩 Analogy:
Imagine building a factory:

🧠 Feature Engineering = Designing the tools and machines (e.g., deciding to filter out stop words or normalize text).

🏭 Pipeline = The conveyor belt system where each machine does its job in sequence.

You could:

Have bad features in a great pipeline (and the model won't learn well)

Or great features with no pipeline (and you can't reuse or scale your code)

✅ So why are they separate teaching points?
Concept	Why it's taught separately
Feature Engineering	Focuses on what makes a good input to ML models
Pipeline Building	Focuses on structuring and automating the flow

But yes — in most projects, pipelines implement feature engineering steps.
