🧠 What does RAG retrieve from?
Yes — RAG retrieves content from a knowledge base, which can be:

✅ 1. Local vector database (most common)
Think of this as a smart, searchable database of documents.

You preprocess your content (e.g. PDFs, FAQs, articles)

Convert text chunks into embeddings (numerical vectors)

Store those in a vector DB like:

FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate, Pinecone, etc.

🟢 When a user asks something, the system:

Converts the question to a vector

Retrieves top-N relevant chunks

Sends those + the question to the LLM to generate a grounded answer

🔁 Works offline, fast, and customizable.

🌐 2. Web-based retrieval (less common, but powerful)
Involves a live search query to the web or a private site.

Uses tools like Bing Search API, SerpAPI, or custom scrapers

Extracts relevant pages, chunks them, and feeds them to the LLM

🟡 Benefits:

Always up-to-date (great for news, weather, stock info)

Broad coverage

🔴 Challenges:

Slower (due to web latency)

Harder to control accuracy/reliability

Needs careful prompt + filtering to avoid hallucination

📊 So which is more common?
Approach	Use Case	Common?
🔒 Local Vector DB	Internal tools, chatbots, document Q&A	✅ Very common
🌐 Web Search	Open-ended assistants, live agents	⚠️ Less common (more complex)

Most enterprise or educational RAG apps use local vector DBs because they are:

Private

Fast

Easier to control

Don't rely on internet access

🧪 Example use cases:
Use Case	Source Type
Chat with your PDFs	✅ Local DB (e.g., PDF chunks in Chroma)
Medical assistant for clinics	✅ Local DB (medical docs, handbooks)
Stock market assistant	🌐 Web (scraped news + APIs)
Tech support bot	✅ Local DB (FAQs, manuals)
AI-powered research buddy	🌐 Web + local hybrid
