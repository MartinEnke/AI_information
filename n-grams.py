'''
.most_common() is a built-in method of Python's Counter class from the collections module. It's incredibly useful for frequency analysis.

üîç What is Counter?
Counter is a subclass of dict that counts the frequency of elements in a list or iterable.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import Counter

words = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a']
counter = Counter(words)

print(counter)
# Output: Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})
üí° .most_common(n)
You can call .most_common(n) on a Counter to get the n most frequent items, sorted by frequency.

python
Copy
Edit
top_2 = counter.most_common(2)
print(top_2)
# Output: [('a', 3), ('b', 2)]
So when you did:

python
Copy
Edit
trigram_freq = Counter(trigrams)
trigram_freq.most_common(1)
You got:

python
Copy
Edit
[(('the', 'fair', 'juliet'), 9)]
Which means:

The trigram ('the', 'fair', 'juliet') appeared 9 times

And it was the most common trigram in your text

üß† Why this is awesome:
You can use it for:

Most common words, bigrams, trigrams

Most clicked URLs

Most frequent errors

Anything where counting and ranking is useful

Let me know if you want to do something like:

Visualize the top 10 trigrams in a bar chart

Filter out common stop word trigrams

Use bigrams for text classification
